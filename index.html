            <p>Some of the things I've worked on professionally are:
              <ul>
                  <li>Changing the way the world deals with death with <a href="https://www.farewill.com/" target="_blank">Farewill</a>, where I am a Group Product Manager. We’ve built an industry leading product experience, a suite of scalable internal tools, and have won National Will Writer of the Year for two years running.</li>
                  <li>Redesigning biographies for the 21st century with <a href="https://www.kindeo.com/" target="_blank">Kindeo</a>, where I was Product Lead. Sadly we didn't find product/market fit, but I learned a lot. If you're trying to solve this too I'd love to share.</li>
                  <li>Fashion ecommerce sites, mobile apps and internal tooling for with <a href="https://secretsales.com/home/" target="_blank">SecretSales</a>, where I was a Product Manager.</li>
                  <li>Various console games with <a href="http://voofoo.games/" target="_blank">VooFoo Studios</a>, where I was a Game Designer and Creative Producer.</li>

        <h3>Things I've Said</h3>

      <div class="eight columns main-content">
        <p>
          I like writing (and talking) about Product Management, team building and mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020 I set myself the goal of improving my public speaking skills. I was honoured to be accepted to give a talk at <a href="https://www.makingjam.io/events/jam-online-2020" target="_blank">JAM London</a> where I spoke about how product teams at Farewill bring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StoiG79U-aE&t=101s" target="_blank">Delight to the Death Industry</a>. After lots of practice, and help from <a href="http://www.resonatecoaching.co/" target="_blank">a speaking coach</a>, I feel really proud of my talk. I've had lots of positive feedback afterwards too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also in 2020, myself and <a href="https://vcfh.work/" target="_blank">Victor Hwang</a> were invited on the <a href="https://pulse.11fs.com/episodes/2020/11/04/farewill-why-will-writing-is-ripe-for-disruption" target="_blank">11fs Pulse podcast</a> to talk about how product teams at Farewill approach understanding our customers in service of modernising the death industry, how we empower our internal teams with great tools, and we walk through the thinking behind some of our user journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've written a really detailed explainer on how my team and I <a href="https://medium.com/farewill/how-to-talk-to-your-customers-by-this-time-next-week-bf0fa182d7a2Here" target="_blank">set up, run, and analyse customer interviews in 7 days</a>. I noticed the repeating tension between the desire to do customer discovery vs the perceived time it takes so I hoped this'd help debunk some of that. I've heard that the article is used as a training resource for other startups in the <a href="https://www.kindredcapital.vc/" target="_blank">Kindred</a> portfolio, and at <a href="https://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">EF</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also written and spoken about mental health, stress, and burnout quite openly after struggling with those things myself. This post about
          <a href="https://medium.com/farewill/dealing-with-startup-stress-a-walk-for-a-walks-sake-e77b9cc74da9blur" target="_blank">de-stressing by going for a walk just to have a walk</a> gets regular positive feedback and has sparked a few quite moving conversations with people I'd otherwise have never known.

        <h3>Things I've Taught</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="eight columns main-content">
        <p>
          I really like teaching people.
        </p>
        <p>I taught a 10-week game making course for Year 7s at a <a href="http://www.st-thomasmore.walsall.sch.uk/" target="_blank">High School in Birmingham</a>. Each student learnt the basics of <a href="https://www.kodugamelab.com/" target="_blank">Kodu</a> and then built their own simple game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I taught a Web Design summer school course at <a href="http://richmix.org.uk/" target="_blank">Rich Mix in London</a>. Each student was a total beginner and by the end of the 5 day course everyone had made a simple website like this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also voluteered with <a href="http://www.ageuk.org.uk/richmonduponthames/" target="_blank">AgeUK</a> to help teach older people how to use tablets and smartphones.
